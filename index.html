        <h2>What are the problems with Districts?</h2>
        <p>If districts are so great, why aren't all FRC competitions Districts?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>More liability</b><br>
          Districts have traditionally required that a region form a non profit to assume
          all responsibility for the events, a so called 'Program Delivery Organization'.
          This is a lot of work, and transfers liability from FIRST to the regional volunteers.
          However, starting in 2026, California will be pioneering a model that does not
          require a PDO.  We are watching that with great interest.
          </li>
          <li><b>More work</b><br>
          Districts require nearly doubling the number of events held each year.  That is
          a lot of work, and requires a lot of additional volunteers, particularly key
          volunteers such as FTAs, head refs, and volunteer coordinators.
          </li>
          <li><b>More fundraising</b><br>
          Districts in PDOs have to perform substantial fund raising.  While the overall
          economics of districts are favorable, to get them up and running requires
          that regional volunteers raise and sustain dedicated funds for the process.
          </li>
          <li><b>Smaller events</b><br>
          Districts are generally smaller events, perhaps held in a high school gym.
          This is in contrast to current Minnesota regionals which are held in impressive
          venues such as the DECC or Mariucci.  They also have reduced sound and light.
          The overall feel of a district event is not as impressive as one of our typical Regionals.  The District
          Championship event will remain an inspiring large scale event.
