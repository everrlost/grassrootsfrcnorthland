        <h1>What are Districts?</h1>
        <p>This video explains how districts work, and why they are the better option for FRC Northland.</p>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjjsq56owi4?si=okJxAr5KUPR7RvZx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Here is
        <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/event-experience">FIRST's official description</a>
        and our list of reasons to prefer districts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>More plays</b><br>
        For the same $6,000 fee that buys you one regional with at most 9 matches, you get
        two events, each with 12 matches.  That's roughly 2.5x times more matches for the same money.
        </li>
        <li><b>More cost effective</b><br>
        District events can cost substantially less than regional events.  That allows
        a regions fundraising dollars to go further, potentially funding other initiatives
        instead of investing all the money in large venues.
        </li>
        <li><b>More local</b><br>
        District events are usually closer to teams, reducing travel time and costs for most
        teams.
        </li>
        <li><b>Less time</b><br>
        District events are only two days, not three.  The impact on student homework
        and missed class time is much less significant.
        </li>
        <li><b>More champs bids</b><br>
        Minnesota and the Dakotas have historically been under represented at Champs.  A district system
        would guarantee that our region sends a proportional number of our teams
        to the world championship.  The new regional qualification system may be a partial solution
        to this problem, but districts would ensure fair representation.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What are the challenges with Districts?</h1>
        <p>If districts are so great, why aren't all FRC competitions Districts?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>More work</b><br>
          Districts require nearly doubling the number of events held each year.  That is
          a lot of work, and requires a lot of additional volunteers, particularly key
          volunteers such as FTAs, head refs, and volunteer coordinators.
          </li>
          <li><b>Smaller events</b><br>
          Districts are generally smaller events, perhaps held in a high school gym.
          This is in contrast to current Northland regionals which are held in larger
          venues such as the DECC or Mariucci Arena.
          The District Championship event will remain an event with a high production value.
          </li>
          <li><b>Possible issues with fundraising and liability</b><br>
          Prior to the announcement of districts for California, districts required
          independent fundraising and the formation of a non profit which could assume
          liability for the events.  The California districts are a new model, backed by
          FIRST, that may no longer have those challenges.  If the Northland uses this new
          model, this may not be a signficant challenge.
          </ul>
